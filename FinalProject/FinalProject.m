% EGR150 SectionNN: Final Project.

% THIS IS A DRAFT - I reserve the right to make minor to moderate changes
% in the project however the overall idea behind the project will stay the
% same.  I am providing this to get you thinking about the project.

% Summary: The goal of this project is do demonstrate proficiency in the
% topics that we have covered through out the semester.  In addition, it is
% supposed to also be a reminder that Matlab is tool that can be used to
% solve "every day" tasks and should be thought of as a path to a solution 
% in future course, employment or curiousities.

% Requirements: Each final project must demonstrate the folowing:
% - Matlab GUI with interactive ui elements (controls)
% - Ability to represent data or user interaction clearly (i.e. useability)
% - Non-trivial flow control.  A project must have flow control logic even
%   if it is only for the purpose of input checking and error handling.
% - Sigificant data calculations, bit-wise operations or vector/array
%   manipulation.
% - Significant file I/O.  For projects that have user input, there must be
%   a way to "save state".  Ex. An inventory system must be able to open,
%   be updated and then close.  Upon relaunch, the updated inventory must
%   be present and not the initial.
%   - Minimum of one file read *
%   - Minimum of one file write/modify *
% - Error handling (either in code or pseudo-code) of how you have handled 
%   or would handle errors.
% - Consideration toward social/environmental/educational/etc. benefits.
% - Prefernce to external/web collected data.

% Project(s): These are just some examples.
% - Data Aggregator (including statistical methods)
% - Inventory Management System 
% - Point of Sale System
% - Image editing/viewing/searching tool **
% - Audio editing/viewing tool
% - Universal encryption tool (must encrypt and decrypt)
% - Interactive single player visual game.
% - Interactive single player logic game.
% - An Approved project from another course (Ex. Calculus, Physics, or
%   Engineering - strongly encouraged if possible).
% - Other (must be approved)

% Deliverables:
% - A working Matlab GUI (.fig) and code file(s) (.m).  Must demonstrate
%   how it works during our final exam time.
% - A five (5) page, professional looking Powerpoint (no fluff pages)
%       include description, flow control, explanation of logic, I/O, error
%       handling and difficulties.

% Bonus:
% - Have the brains of your GUI in separate function files that can then be
%   called using another script (without the GUI).  Please see me if you
%   are interested in attempting this as we did not specifically cover.

% * These are required to submit final project.  Any exception must be
% approved by the instructor.
% ** Image editing projects must be significant and must be approved by the
% instructor.
% *** Please note certain projects have been overly or poorly done and
% therefore are probably not going to be approved.
